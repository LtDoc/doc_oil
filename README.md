# doc_oil
Rewritten version of rgn_miner to collect oil in the heartlands and then deliver it to Emerald Ranch. It is written for VORP-Core in RedM

You need to be set to the Oiler job in order to do the job. Either do it through a society script (I recommend syn_society) or set it to none so anyone who joins and doesn't have a whitelisted job is able to do it. 

You can edit the config in order to change the pay. You will need to add rawpetrol into your database. 

**Will not provide support on here for this script. I use it on my server (Diamond Valley Roleplay) and am just sharing it so other people can use it if they want it.
